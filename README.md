# EPD_download
Download data from the English Prescribing Dataset

Inspired by https://github.com/nhsbsa-data-analytics/open-data-portal-api/blob/master/open-data-portal-api.R

Motivation:
Openprescribing is fantastic but understandably limited to last 5 years of data. If you want to go back in time, you can do it drug by drug using this script. It's a bit slow but can run overnight in a screen session.

usage: Rscript fetch_epd.R --help
